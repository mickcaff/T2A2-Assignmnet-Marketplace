# FarmPlace - Farm Services Marketplace

![](/md_images/logo_full.svg)

### What is FarmPlace?
Farmplace is a two sided marketplace which offers productivity improvements for agricultural service providers and farmers.

#### Why does the Australian agriculture industry need a services marketplace?

The technology used within the Australian agricultural industry is increasing at an astonishing rate. Farmers who can implement the latest technologies reap the cost advantages when production becomes more efficient. However, along with the advancement in technology, there is also an associated increase in price for more advanced machinery. 

It has become far too expensive for farmers to own all the latest machinery, especially when sitting idle waiting for the next crop to be planted or harvested. This has led to an increasing trend for farmers to outsource specialised operators and machinery for specific tasks within the growing cycle. These tasks could include planting, harvesting, livestock transport, spraying, or agronomy services. 

Currently no two-sided marketplace exists within the Australian agriculture industry. Before FarmPlace, farmers would rely on the contractors that they had previously used or could contact through traditional means. FarmPlace offers a marketplace where contractors can find more prospective business and farmers can better evaluate potential contractors based on price, reviews, location, equipment etc. 

While farming can appear to be a slow process, there are critical windows of opportunity in which a crop needs to be planted, harvested or livestock moved location. During these critical points in time, Farmers can rely on FarmPlace to let them know which contractors they should be using. Along with the benefit to farmers, contractors can rely on FarmPlace to find more business, which will allow them to have a higher return on their investment in equipment.

#### Who can post their services on FarmPlace?

Farmplace is open to any contractors who offer sevices to farmers. This may include:
- Planting
- Harvesting
- Spraying
- Transportation
